I just want to make one quick note about
the version of R that you'll be using in this
class. You might notice from some of the videos, that the videos are made using R version
3.0.3. Which was the most current version at the
time the video was made. However, as of now, the most current
version of R is 3.1.1. And so I encourage you to install that
version of R, which should be the default version that you find when
you go to the R website. So don't try digging around for older
version of R you won't need them. So I, in general I always encourage people
to use the latest version of, of software because
those will have the latest features. And they will have hopefully fixed bugs that may have been present in earlier
versions. So, for this version of the course use for
our version 3.1.1. Thanks a lot.
